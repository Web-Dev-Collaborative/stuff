<p>Message Security Layer (MSL) is an extensible and flexible secure messaging protocol that can be used to transport data between two or more communicating entities. Data may also be associated with specific users, and treated as confidential or non-replayable if so desired.</p>

<p>This Javadoc is limited to the classes and interfaces used by an application to properly configure its MSL stack and to engage in MSL-based communication with other compatible applications. The application entry point is the <a href="com/netflix/msl/msg/MslControl.html">MslControl</a> class.</p>

<p>For more information refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/msl/wiki">Protocol documentation</a>.</p>
