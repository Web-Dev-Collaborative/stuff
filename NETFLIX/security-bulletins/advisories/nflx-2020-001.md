###### Advisory Title:
Server-Side Template Injection in Netflix Conductor

###### Author:
Aladdin Almubayed / amubaied@netflix.com

###### Release Date:
2020-02-24

###### Application:
Conductor

###### CVE ID
CVE-2020-9296

###### Source:
https://github.com/Netflix/conductor

###### Severity:
High

###### Overview:
The GitHub Security Labs team (@pwntester) identified a security vulnerability in Netflix Conductor.  The vulnerability discovered allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

###### Impact:
This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution in Netflix Conductor versions <= v2.25.3

###### Description:
Netflix Conductor uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint violation error messages, different types of interpolation are supported, including Java EL expressions. If an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed to ConstraintValidatorContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate() argument, they will be able to run arbitrary Java code.

###### The Fix
Conductor has been [patched](https://github.com/Netflix/conductor/pull/1543) as of 24 Feb 2020. The fix updated validation code to use Apache bval rather than hibernate-validator, which is vulnerable.

###### Patch:
Users of Conductor should adopt the patched version of Conductor (>=v2.25.3).
