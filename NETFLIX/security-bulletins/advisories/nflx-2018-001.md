###### Advisory Title:
Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery in Hystrix-Dashboard  

###### Author:
Patrick Thomas / patrickt@netflix.com

###### Release Date:
2018-01-10

###### Application:
Hystrix (specifically hystrix-dashboard)

###### Release:
Hystrix-Dashboard, all versions

###### Source:
Former: https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard
New: https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/hystrix-dashboard

###### Severity:
Critical

###### Overview:
Hystrix includes an optional hystrix-dashboard component to provide a web dashboard of hystrix status. The dashboard is vulnerable to server-side request forgery in the proxy.stream and monitor.html endpoints. It is recommended that hystrix-dashboard not be used except behind authorization checks.

###### Patch:
Hystrix-dashboard is being moved from the main Netflix/Hystrix repository to the Netflix-Skunkworks organization to emphasize that it is an optional and unmaintained component.
