# ember-nf-graph

A Component-based DSL for creating graphs in your Ember app. The goal of the library is to
create a set of components that allows application or component authors to build graphs in a
compositional way. This includes components for templated axes, graph lines, areas, stacked areas, bar graphs, and much more. Check the [documentation](//netflix.github.io/ember-nf-graph/docs) for more information.

- [Examples](//netflix.github.io/ember-nf-graph-examples/dist)



A basic graph example is as follows:

```js
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model() {
    return {
      myLineData: [
        { x: 0, y: 12 },
        { x: 1, y: 32 },
        { x: 2, y: 42 },
        // ...
      ],
      myAreaData: [
        { x: 0, y: 43 },
        { x: 1, y: 54 },
        { x: 2, y: 13 },
        // ...
      ]
    };
  }
});
```

```hbs
{{#nf-graph width=500 height=300 as |nf|}}
  {{#nf.graph as |graph|}}
    <!-- add a line -->
    {{graph.line data=model.myLineData}}

    <!-- add an area -->
    {{graph.area data=model.myAreaData}}

    <!-- mix in any SVG element you want -->
    <circle cx="40" cy="40" r="10"></circle>
  {{/nf.graph}}

	<!-- axis ticks are templateable as well -->
  {{#nf.y-axis as |tick|}}
    <text>{{tick.value}}</text>
  {{/nf.y-axis}}


  {{#nf.x-axis as |tick|}}
    <text>{{tick.value}}</text>
  {{/nf.x-axis}}
{{/nf-graph}}
```
