<!--
This project is a very thin loading wraper around the Terminal JS SDK. Please only file issues
here that you believe represent bugs with the loader, not the SDK itself.

If you're having general trouble with the Terminal JS SDK or your Stripe integration,
please reach out to us using the form at https://support.stripe.com/email or
come chat with us at #stripe on freenode. We're very proud of our level of
service, and we're more than happy to help you out with your integration.
