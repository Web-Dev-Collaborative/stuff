# 0.15.1

https://github.com/burke/zeus/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1

* Revert IRB is not a module change in favor of supporting standard rails
  console and Pry usage. `zeus console` now works out of the box as long as you

  something like that, please create your own custom plan and zeus.json file to
  workaround the errors you receive.

* Feature: Add TEST_HELPER environment variable to force Rspec or (#393, @despo)

### 0.13.1

* Handle the `shared_connection` hack that some people do to share an AR
  connection between threads (77d2b9bfc67977dfd8c17eed03fe2a8a25870c11)

* Improved a few cases where client processes disconnect unexpectedly.

* Changed up the slave/master IPC, solving a bunch of issues on Linux, by
  switching from a socket to a pipe.

* Client terminations are now handled a bit more gracefully. The terminal is
  always reset from raw mode, and the cursor is reset to column 0.
