# Shipyard
Shipyard is a web UI for http://docker.io

To run the latest version on port 8000:

`docker run -p :8000 ehazlett/shipyard`

Or to run on a custom port (leave the `-p` option off to get random port):

`docker run -p 8005:8000 ehazlett/shipyard`

Username: admin
Password: shipyard

# Dev Setup
Shipyard needs Redis for caching and queueing.  By default, it assumes Redis
is running on localhost.

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python manage.py syncdb --noinput`
* `python manage.py migrate`
* `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* `python manage.py runserver`
* `python manage.py rqworker shipyard` (in another terminal)
* Open browser to http://localhost:8000
* Add a host (i.e. 127.0.0.1 for local docker)

Alternate dev setup using vagrant (this will install all dependencies including
docker itself for a self-contained dev environment):

* `vagrant up`
* `vagrant ssh`
* `python manage.py syncdb --noinput`
* `python manage.py migrate`
* `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* `./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
* `./manage.py rqworker shipyard` (in separate ssh session)
* Open browser to http://localhost:8000

# Applications
Applications are groups of containers that are accessible by a domain name.  The easiest
way to test this is to add some local `/etc/hosts` entries for fake domains pointed to `10.10.10.25` (the vagrant vm).  For example, add the following to `/etc/hosts`:

```
10.10.10.25 foo.local
```

Then you can create a new application with the domain `foo.local`.  Attach one or more containers and then access http://foo.local in your browser and it should hit Hipache and be routed to the contianers.
