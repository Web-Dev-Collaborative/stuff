`annoy-java` is a Java client for [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy).

It was built to give us access to ANN queries from JVM languages, for indices
built by other Python pipelines.

# Limitations

- annoy-java only implements loading trees built by the Python version of
  annoy; it cannot yet create its own.
