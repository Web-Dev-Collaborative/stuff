# Common values for tests which pass objects through JNI
# This file is used to generate test constant definitions for both Java and C++

# Format is:
# Java type @ Constant name @ Constant value @ [JAVA|CPP]
#
# The optional 4th field is for when Java and C++ can't share the same entry. Note that for C++ 11
# string prefixes this is often not needed because the generator handles the common cases.
