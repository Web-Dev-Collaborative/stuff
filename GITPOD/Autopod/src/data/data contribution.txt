--- badDomains.json

This file contains an array of hashes for illegal manga/anime aggregators, for link filtering (it's currently only used by a few modules)

Use the simple java-hash on the domain name, without the top level domain (so "wikipedia.org" would be just "wikipedia")


function hashCode(string){
	var hash = 0, i, chr;
	if(string.length === 0){
		return hash
	}
	for(i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
		chr   = string.charCodeAt(i);
		hash  = ((hash << 5) - hash) + chr;
		hash |= 0;
	}
	return hash
}


It's not supposed to be cryptocraphically secure, the purpouse is just to not dump a huge catalogue of such sites to anyone taking a glance.

If you submit a new domain, your pull request must mention the plaintext domain it blocks.

If desirable, a list of blocked sites can probably be provided.
