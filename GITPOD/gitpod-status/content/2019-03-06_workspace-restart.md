title: Workspaces need restart

Due to an unexpected issue while deploying a fresh version, running workspaces can not connect to the API any more. As a result, git actions as well as controlling the workspace from within Theia stopped working.
As a workaround, stop running workspaces from the your [dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) and restart them. Your state will be restored as usual.
