The goal of [contribute.dev](https://contribute.dev) is to: 
- show aspiring OSS newcomers cool projects they could join & start contributing to instantly.
- show maintainers how to make their projects newcomer-friendly, esp. by fully automating their dev setup.

Exceptions are always possible. Please feel free to reach out if you think your project would be a great fit, by explaining how your project gives new contributors a fantastic first experience. Or reach out with any question, we're super happy to collaborate. :slightly_smiling_face:

Note: Project should have: A minimum of 500 stars and 10 contributors.
-->

### Is your project's development setup fully automated? How to use it?

<!-- 
Project should have a fully automated setup: ready in one click / one minute, ideally fully online, with nothing to install or configure on your computer first. It's relatively easy to achieve this with Gitpod, by following this tutorial https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpodify/ 
-->

### Why is your project interesting/exciting to contribute to?

### Does your project have an active community?

### Does your project have basic newcomer onboarding docs? (e.g. CONTRIBUTING.md, good-first-issues...)
