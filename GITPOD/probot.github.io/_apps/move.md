A GitHub App that moves issues between repositories.

## Usage

1. **[Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/move)**
   for all source and target repositories
2. Create `.github/move.yml` in the source repository based on the template below
3. Move an issue by creating a comment with this command: `/move to <repo>`

Users must have the following permissions in order to move issues:

* Write access to the source repository
* Write access to the target repository (when the source or target repository
  is private, or when they have different owners)

#### Configuration

Create `.github/move.yml` in the default branch of the source repository
to enable the app. The file can be empty, or it can override any of these
default settings:

```yaml
# Configuration for move-issues - https://github.com/dessant/move-issues

# Delete the command comment when it contains no other content
deleteCommand: true

# Close the source issue after moving
closeSourceIssue: true

# Lock the source issue after moving
lockSourceIssue: false

# Mention issue and comment authors
mentionAuthors: true

# Preserve mentions in the issue content
keepContentMentions: false

# Set custom aliases for targets
# aliases:
#   r: repo
#   or: owner/repo

# Repository to extend settings from
# _extends: repo
```

#### Command Syntax

```
/move [to ][<owner>/]<repo>
```

###### Examples:

```
/move to repo
/move to owner/repo
/move repo
/move owner/repo
```
